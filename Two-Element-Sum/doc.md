Given a set S of n integers and another integer x, determines whether or not there exist two elements in S whose sum is
exactly x

## N Element sum
Given a integer list and a range (min and max), find out if  there is a combination of integers that add up to a number within the given range. You can use any integer as many times as you like. You don't have to find out how many such combinations are possible / enumerate all of them. Just return true or false

## Two Sum
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
