## Preorder without recursion
By understanding how the recursion works using stacks
Implement the preorder using a stack to store nodes which will be printed at a later time
- Pop the stack
- Print the popped node
- Add the right child in stack
- Add the left child in stack
- Loop continues until stack is empty


## Lowest common ancestor
