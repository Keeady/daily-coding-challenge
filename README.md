# My Daily algorithm challenge
This is my daily algorithm implementation challenge using the ctci book. All implementations are in javascript and I have also added my own implementation of the basic data structures such as linked list, stacks, queues, etc. instead of using arrays.
Each implementation is unit tested with unit.js
1. isUnique
2. Hermione's potion encoder
3. Remove Dups
4. Peaks-And-Valley
