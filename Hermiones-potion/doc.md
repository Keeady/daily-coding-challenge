We are helping Hermione to encode her potions into fewest steps as possible
The potions have a pattern as follows:
ABABCABABC
So she figures that she can encode the steps of her potions using * as below
AB*C*

Implement an encoder that will output the encoded potion for Hermione.

Assumptions:
- case insensitive
- only letters in A-Z
- each step is a single character
