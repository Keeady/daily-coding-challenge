Q) Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.
Assumptions:
- case insensitive
- ignore spaces
- empty string is assumed unique

Follow up: What if you cannot use additional data structures?
- One option is to use nested for loops
- Another option is to use array to store each character according to their encoding. This may
require additional assumption such as only ascii characters are expected
