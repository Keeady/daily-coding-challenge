Given an input array of integers, return an array of the same size such that that ith element in the output array is the
product of every element in the input array other than the ith element of the input array. Restriction: do not use division
in your algorithm. This should be done in O(n) time complexity.


Write a function that, given a dot-separated path to a JSON-like object changes an input string to another value is the
string matches. Each level of the object (except the first) might be a string, a list of strings, an another object,
a list of objects, or a list of other objects. ... To be honest, the guy who asked the question did a poor job of phrasing

 { a: { b: '1', c: '2' } }
 a.b.c


Write a function to reverse an integer, without using any intermediate storage except for other integer values.
